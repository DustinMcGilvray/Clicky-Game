## Overview
A Memory Game built with React.JS to test the players mental fortitude. To begin, a player clicks on an album cover and will be awarded a point. The images will shuffle and the player clicks on another album cover. If the image hasn't been clicked, another point will be awarded. Otherwise, the high score will persist and the game restarts.
